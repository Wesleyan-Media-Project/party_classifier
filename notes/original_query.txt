The original set of ads with known party_all was pulled (presumably by Pavel) like this:

SELECT
  ad_id,
  pd_id,
  disclaimer,
  page_name,
  ad_creative_body,
  ad_creative_link_caption,
  ad_creative_link_description,
  ad_creative_link_title
FROM
  `wmp-local-news.fb.full_archive`
WHERE
  pd_id IN (
  SELECT
    pd_id
  FROM
    `wmp-local-news.fb.wmp_fb_entities_v101521`
  WHERE
    party_all != 'MISSING')

However, this a) also gets ads that aren't in the 2020 cycle, and b) for some reason also misses some ads that are in the 1.18m dataset. Consequently this is no longer used.
